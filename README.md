# Relevant-Slice-Selection-of-MRI
This is the implementation code for the "Relevant Slice Selection" chapter in the paper "A Deep Learning-Based Computer-Aided Determination Method for Dominant Follicle Identification and Antral Follicle Count in Pelvic MRI Images".
To use this module, please place the trained YOLO model weights, then create the following directory structure: a "radiologist_selection" folder, a "test_images" folder (each containing patient-specific subfolders), and a designated folder to store the selection results.
